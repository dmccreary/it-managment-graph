# Observability, Monitoring, and Automated Discovery

## Summary

This chapter explores how modern observability practices and automated discovery tools can continuously update IT management graphs without manual intervention. You'll learn about observability fundamentals, monitoring systems, telemetry collection, and cutting-edge technologies like OpenTelemetry and eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) that enable automated dependency discovery. The chapter covers network topology, service topology, dynamic topology mapping, and techniques for configuration drift detection. You'll understand how these automated approaches address one of the key failures of traditional CMDBs, which relied on manual data entry and quickly became outdated, by enabling self-updating IT management graphs that reflect the true current state of the IT environment.
