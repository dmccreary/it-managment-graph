# Query Performance and Real-Time Operations

## Summary

This chapter examines the performance characteristics that make graph databases suitable for real-time operational IT management. You'll learn about real-time query capabilities, query latency, response time metrics, and the performance implications of different query approaches. The chapter explores scalability patterns including horizontal and vertical scaling, and introduces graph-specific metrics such as graph complexity, graph density, node degree, in-degree, and out-degree. You'll understand how these metrics affect query performance and system design, and learn why native graph databases can execute complex multi-hop queries in sub-second timeframes while equivalent SQL queries with recursive joins may take minutes or fail entirely. This performance advantage is fundamental to enabling real-time impact analysis during incidents.
