# Introduction to ITIL and Configuration Management

## Summary

This foundational chapter introduces the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework and its approach to configuration management. You'll learn about configuration items, the Configuration Management Database (CMDB), and traditional IT service management processes including service support, service delivery, change management, incident management, and problem management. This chapter establishes the historical context and legacy approaches that led to the need for modern graph-based solutions, setting the stage for understanding why traditional CMDB implementations have consistently failed despite decades of investment.
