# Graph Traversal and Dependency Analysis

## Summary

This comprehensive chapter explores how graph traversal techniques enable sophisticated dependency analysis for IT management. You'll learn how to trace dependencies upstream and downstream, calculate blast radius for change impact, perform root cause analysis, and map complex dependency chains. The chapter covers various types of dependencies including service dependencies, application dependencies, and infrastructure dependencies, while teaching practical techniques for detecting circular dependencies and managing dependency maps. This represents the core capability that makes graph databases superior to relational systems for IT management, enabling real-time transitive dependency analysis that would require complex recursive joins in SQL.
