# Graph Database Technologies and Query Languages

## Summary

This chapter moves from graph theory to practical graph database implementation by examining different approaches to storing and querying graph data. You'll learn the critical distinction between native graph storage and graph layers built on top of relational databases, understanding the performance implications of each approach. The chapter introduces Neo4j as a leading native graph database platform and teaches Cypher query language, providing hands-on skills for working with graph databases. You'll also explore how graph queries enable pattern matching and relationship-based querying that would be cumbersome or impossible in SQL.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 8 concepts from the learning graph:

1. DAG
2. Cycle Detection
3. Native Graph Storage
4. Graph Layer
5. Neo4j
