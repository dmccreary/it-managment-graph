# Compliance, Risk Management, and Security

## Summary

This chapter addresses how IT management graphs support regulatory compliance, risk management, and security governance in modern organizations. You'll learn about major regulatory frameworks including HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), and DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act), understanding how graph-based dependency analysis enables continuous compliance checking. The chapter covers audit trails, compliance reporting, risk assessment methodologies, and security models including role-based access control (RBAC). You'll understand how graph traversal queries can instantly identify all systems processing regulated data, trace data flows across system boundaries, and verify that security controls are properly configured throughout the IT estate, capabilities that are critical for demonstrating compliance to auditors and regulators.
