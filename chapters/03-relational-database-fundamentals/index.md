# Relational Database Fundamentals

## Summary

This chapter provides a comprehensive introduction to relational database management systems (RDBMS), SQL, and the structural elements that define relational databases including schemas, tables, keys, and joins. You'll learn how RDBMS systems store and query data, understand the role of indexes and query optimization, and explore concepts like schema rigidity and evolution. This technical foundation is essential for understanding why traditional CMDBs built on RDBMS technology struggle with the complex relationship management required for modern IT estates, particularly when handling transitive dependencies and multi-hop queries.
