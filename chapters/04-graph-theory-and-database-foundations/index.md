# Graph Theory and Graph Database Foundations

## Summary

This chapter marks the transition from relational to graph-based thinking by introducing fundamental graph theory concepts and their application to database systems. You'll learn about nodes, edges, vertices, relationships, and property graphs, understanding how these structures naturally represent connected data. The chapter covers different types of graphs including directed and undirected graphs, and introduces Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) which are particularly important for dependency management. You'll also explore graph traversal fundamentals and basic graph algorithms that form the foundation for the advanced dependency analysis covered in later chapters.
