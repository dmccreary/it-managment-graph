# Data Quality and Data Management Excellence

## Summary

This chapter addresses the critical importance of data quality and governance for effective IT management graphs. You'll learn about the DMBOK (Data Management Body of Knowledge) framework and its application to IT management data, exploring data quality dimensions including accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, and validity. The chapter covers essential data management concepts including metadata, data lineage, data catalogs, master data management, and reference data. You'll understand the roles of data stewards, data owners, and data custodians, and learn how policy enforcement and access control protect sensitive IT management information. This foundation is essential because even the most sophisticated graph database is only as valuable as the quality of data it contains.
