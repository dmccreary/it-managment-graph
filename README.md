## About

This repository contains educational materials for **ISMG 620: IT Management Graphs - From Legacy CMDB to Modern Graph-Based Solutions**, a graduate-level course examining the evolution of IT configuration management from traditional relational database approaches to modern graph-based solutions.

The site explores why legacy Configuration Management Database (CMDB) implementations have consistently failed despite decades of investment, and how graph databases are revolutionizing IT management through real-time multi-hop transitive dependency analysis.

## Features

- **Learning Graph Visualization**: Interactive network visualization of 200+ IT management concepts with dependencies
- **MicroSims**: Web-based interactive simulations using vis.js for exploring concept relationships
- **Taxonomy System**: Categorization across 12+ domains (ITIL, Graph Databases, Query Performance, etc.)
- **Python Toolchain**: Scripts for validating, analyzing, and transforming learning graph data
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Course materials, glossary, references, and prompts for AI-assisted learning

## Content Structure

- **Course Description**: Graduate-level learning outcomes across Bloom's Taxonomy levels
- **Learning Graph**: 200+ concepts with dependencies, taxonomy classifications, and quality metrics
- **Interactive Viewer**: Search, filter by taxonomy, view statistics, and explore concept relationships
- **Python Scripts**: CSV-to-JSON conversion, graph validation, quality analysis, taxonomy distribution
- **Educational Prompts**: AI prompts for generating course content and assessments
