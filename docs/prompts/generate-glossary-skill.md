⏺ I'll help you generate a comprehensive glossary from your learning graph's
  concept list. Let me start by setting up a task list and validating the
  inputs.

⏺ Read(docs/glossary.md)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines

⏺ Read(docs/learning-graph/learning-graph.csv)
  ⎿  Read 3 lines

⏺ Excellent! I found:
  - 200 concepts in the learning-graph.csv
  - A comprehensive course description for context
  - An existing glossary.md that's currently just a template

  Let me update my progress and analyze the concept list quality.

⏺ Write(docs/learning-graph/analyze-concept-quality.py)
  ⎿  Wrote 112 lines to docs/learning-graph/analyze-concept-quality.py
     #!/usr/bin/env python3

⏺ Bash(cd /Users/danmccreary/Documents/ws/it-managment-graph/docs/learning-graph

  ⎿  # Concept List Quality Analysis

     **Total Concepts:** 200
     … +22 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Excellent! The concept list has a quality score of 98.3/100 - ready for
  glossary generation. Found:
  - ✓ No duplicates
  - 7 minor formatting issues (acceptable)
  - 4 length issues (2%, well within target)

⏺ Now I'll generate comprehensive ISO 11179-compliant definitions for all 200
   concepts. Given the scale, I'll create an intelligent generator that
  produces contextually appropriate definitions based on taxonomy and
  dependencies.

     from collections import defaultdict
     … +267 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I've created a generator framework, but given the scope (200 terms
  requiring high-quality, hand-crafted definitions), let me take a more
  comprehensive approach. I'll generate the complete glossary with
  well-crafted ISO 11179-compliant definitions for all terms.

  Let me create the glossary in batches, organizing by taxonomy categories:

     # Glossary of Terms
     This glossary provides ISO 11179-compliant definitions for all concepts
     in the IT Management Graph learning graph. Each definition follows ISO
     11179 metadata registry guidelines: precise, concise, distinct,
     non-circular, and unencumbered with business rules.
     ## ISO 11179 Standards
     Each definition in this glossary adheres to five key principles:
     1. **Precise** - Accurately captures the concept's meaning in the
     context of IT management
     2. **Concise** - Brief and focused (typically 20-50 words)
     … +1444 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Excellent! I've generated a comprehensive glossary with all 200 ISO
  11179-compliant definitions. Now let me replace the template glossary with
  this complete version.

⏺ Bash(cd /Users/danmccreary/Documents/ws/it-managment-graph/docs && mv
      glossary.md glossary-old.md && mv glossary-complete.md glossary.md)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Now let me generate a comprehensive quality report to assess the glossary
  against ISO 11179 standards.

⏺ Good progress! The quality report shows 88.8/100 - Excellent with:

  ⎿  CSV has 200 terms

     … +13 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I found the issues:
  - Missing: Dynamic Topology, RDBMS, Relational Database
  - Ordering issues: A couple of terms out of alphabetical order

  Let me check the glossary and add the missing terms:

⏺ Bash(cd /Users/danmccreary/Documents/ws/it-managment-graph/docs && grep -n
      "^#### R" glossary.md | head -20)
  ⎿  1069:#### RBAC

⏺ Bash(grep -c "^#### Relational Database" glossary.md && grep -c "^#### RDBMS"

⏺ The terms are indeed missing. Let me add all three missing terms in the
  correct alphabetical positions:

⏺ Read(glossary.md)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines

⏺ I need to fix the alphabetical ordering and add the missing terms. Let me
  search for the correct insertion points:

⏺ Bash(grep -n "^#### D" glossary.md | grep -E "(Dynatrace|eBPF)")
  ⎿  481:#### Dynatrace

⏺ Read(glossary.md)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines

⏺ Now I'll add the three missing terms in their correct alphabetical
  positions. Let me start with "Dynamic Topology":
