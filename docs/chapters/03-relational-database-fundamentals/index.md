## Introduction to Relational Databases

A **relational database** organizes data into tables (also called relations) where each table represents a specific entity type, and relationships between entities are represented through key references. Developed by Edgar F. Codd at IBM in 1970, the relational model introduced a mathematical foundation for data management based on set theory and predicate logic. This approach revolutionized database design by providing a structured, consistent method for storing and retrieving data that has dominated enterprise computing for over five decades.

A **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** is software that implements the relational model, providing mechanisms for defining database structures, manipulating data, enforcing integrity constraints, and controlling concurrent access. Popular RDBMS products include Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and IBM Db2. These systems share common characteristics: they support SQL as a query language, enforce ACID transaction properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), and use a schema-based approach to define data structures before data can be inserted.

The relational model's success stems from several key advantages:

- **Data independence:** Application logic separates from physical storage implementation, allowing database administrators to optimize storage without affecting applications
- **Mathematical rigor:** Set-based operations provide predictable query results with formal semantics
- **Declarative queries:** SQL allows developers to specify what data they want without describing how to retrieve it
- **Data integrity:** Constraints enforce business rules at the database level, preventing invalid data entry
- **Standardization:** SQL standards enable skills and code portability across different RDBMS products

However, as we'll explore throughout this chapter, the relational model also imposes certain constraints and performance characteristics that create challenges when managing highly connected data such as IT infrastructure dependencies. Understanding these fundamentals provides the foundation for appreciating why graph databases offer advantages for specific use cases.

## Database Schema: Defining Structure

A **database schema** defines the structure of a database, including the names and types of tables, columns within each table, constraints on data values, and relationships between tables. The schema serves as a blueprint that must be defined before data can be stored. This approach, known as "schema-on-write," contrasts with "schema-on-read" approaches used in some NoSQL databases where structure is interpreted when data is accessed rather than enforced when data is written.

Schemas provide several benefits for data management. They enforce data types, ensuring that numeric fields contain numbers and date fields contain valid dates. They define required versus optional fields through NULL/NOT NULL constraints. They establish uniqueness requirements and default values. Most importantly for relational databases, schemas define the relationships between tables through foreign key constraints that reference primary keys in other tables.

Consider a simple IT asset management schema with three tables:

| Table: Servers | |
|----------------|----------|
| Column Name | Data Type |
| server_id | INTEGER (Primary Key) |
| hostname | VARCHAR(255) |
| ip_address | VARCHAR(15) |
| location_id | INTEGER (Foreign Key → Locations) |
| purchase_date | DATE |
| status | VARCHAR(20) |

| Table: Applications | |
|---------------------|----------|
| Column Name | Data Type |
| app_id | INTEGER (Primary Key) |
| app_name | VARCHAR(255) |
| version | VARCHAR(50) |
| server_id | INTEGER (Foreign Key → Servers) |
| owner_team | VARCHAR(100) |

| Table: Locations | |
|------------------|----------|
| Column Name | Data Type |
| location_id | INTEGER (Primary Key) |
| data_center | VARCHAR(100) |
| city | VARCHAR(100) |
| region | VARCHAR(50) |

This schema defines three entity types (Servers, Applications, Locations) and their attributes. Foreign key references establish relationships: Applications reference Servers (indicating which server hosts each application), and Servers reference Locations (indicating physical placement). While this structure works well for straightforward one-to-many relationships, we'll see later how it becomes problematic for complex many-to-many relationships and multi-hop dependency chains.

## Tables, Columns, and Rows: The Building Blocks

At the most fundamental level, relational databases store data in **tables**. Each table represents a collection of similar entities—for example, a Servers table contains information about servers, while an Applications table contains information about applications. Tables consist of **columns** (also called attributes or fields) that define what properties each entity has, and **rows** (also called records or tuples) that represent individual entity instances.

A **column** defines a specific attribute of the entity, including the attribute name and data type. Common data types include INTEGER for whole numbers, VARCHAR for variable-length text, DATE for calendar dates, BOOLEAN for true/false values, and DECIMAL for precise numeric values with decimal places. Each column also specifies whether NULL values (representing missing or unknown data) are permitted. Column definitions constrain what data can be entered, preventing type mismatches and ensuring data consistency.

A **row** represents a single entity instance with specific values for each column. In the Servers table, one row might represent a specific physical server with hostname "web-prod-01", IP address "10.0.1.50", and status "active". Each row in a table should be uniquely identifiable, which leads us to the concept of primary keys.

The following comparison illustrates how entity concepts map to relational database structures:

| Conceptual Model | Relational Database | Example |
|------------------|---------------------|---------|
| Entity Type | Table | "Servers" (all servers in organization) |
| Entity Instance | Row | Server named "web-prod-01" at IP 10.0.1.50 |
| Entity Attribute | Column | "hostname", "ip_address", "status" |
| Attribute Value | Cell value | "web-prod-01", "10.0.1.50", "active" |
| Entity Relationship | Foreign Key + JOIN | Applications reference Servers via server_id |

This mapping from conceptual entities to database tables forms the foundation of relational database design. The discipline of designing effective schemas—determining which tables to create, what columns each should have, and how they relate—is called database normalization, which organizes data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity.

## Primary Keys and Foreign Keys: Establishing Identity and Relationships

A **primary key** is a column (or combination of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table. No two rows can have the same primary key value, and primary key values cannot be NULL. Primary keys serve as the definitive identifier for each entity instance. In our Servers table, server_id serves as the primary key—each server receives a unique numeric identifier that distinguishes it from all other servers regardless of whether other attributes (like hostname) might change over time.

Primary keys are typically implemented as auto-incrementing integers (1, 2, 3, ...) or as globally unique identifiers (GUIDs/UUIDs). Integer keys offer simplicity and compact storage, while GUIDs provide distributed uniqueness without coordination between database instances. The choice depends on architectural requirements such as whether multiple systems independently create records that will later be merged.

A **foreign key** is a column in one table that references the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between the tables. Foreign keys enable us to represent connections between entities without duplicating all the related entity's data. In the Applications table, the server_id column is a foreign key referencing the Servers table—this indicates which server hosts each application. Rather than duplicating all server details (hostname, IP address, location) in every application row, we store only the server_id reference and use JOIN operations to retrieve related server information when needed.

Foreign keys enforce referential integrity—database constraints that prevent invalid references. If an application record has server_id = 42, the RDBMS verifies that a server with server_id = 42 actually exists in the Servers table. This prevents orphaned records and maintains data consistency. Additionally, foreign key constraints can specify what happens when referenced rows are deleted: CASCADE (delete dependent rows), SET NULL (set foreign key to NULL), or RESTRICT (prevent deletion if dependent rows exist).

The relationship between primary and foreign keys creates the "relational" aspect of relational databases:

- **One-to-many relationships:** One server hosts many applications (Servers → Applications). Implemented with foreign key in the "many" side (Applications.server_id references Servers.server_id).

- **Many-to-many relationships:** Many applications depend on many other applications. Requires a junction table (Application_Dependencies) with two foreign keys, one referencing each side of the relationship.

- **One-to-one relationships:** One employee has one security badge (rare in practice). Can be implemented with foreign key in either table, or by merging tables entirely.

## SQL: The Language of Relational Databases

**Structured Query Language (SQL)** is the standard programming language for managing and querying relational databases. While **SQL** is technically an acronym, it's commonly pronounced "sequel" and treated as a word in its own right. SQL provides a declarative syntax where you specify what data you want to retrieve or modify without describing the step-by-step procedure for how to do it. The RDBMS query optimizer determines the most efficient execution plan based on available indexes, data distribution statistics, and query structure.

SQL includes several categories of commands:

- **Data Definition Language (DDL):** CREATE, ALTER, DROP commands that define schema structures (tables, columns, indexes, constraints)
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE commands that query and modify data
- **Data Control Language (DCL):** GRANT, REVOKE commands that manage user permissions
- **Transaction Control:** BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK commands that group operations into atomic units

For IT management applications, SELECT queries form the most common SQL usage, retrieving data based on specified criteria. A basic SELECT statement includes:

- **SELECT clause:** Specifies which columns to retrieve
- **FROM clause:** Identifies which table(s) contain the data
- **WHERE clause:** Filters rows based on conditions
- **ORDER BY clause:** Sorts results
- **GROUP BY clause:** Aggregates rows with common values

Example SQL queries for our IT asset schema:

```sql
-- Find all active servers
SELECT hostname, ip_address, status
FROM Servers
WHERE status = 'active'
ORDER BY hostname;

-- Count applications by server
SELECT s.hostname, COUNT(a.app_id) as app_count
FROM Servers s
LEFT JOIN Applications a ON s.server_id = a.server_id
GROUP BY s.hostname
ORDER BY app_count DESC;

-- Find servers with no applications
SELECT s.hostname, s.ip_address
FROM Servers s
LEFT JOIN Applications a ON s.server_id = a.server_id
WHERE a.app_id IS NULL;
```

SQL's declarative nature provides significant advantages. The same query can execute efficiently on small databases and scale to tables with billions of rows, with the query optimizer adapting execution strategies based on data volume. Developers don't need to manually navigate data structures or manage memory—the RDBMS handles these concerns. However, as we'll see when discussing joins and multi-hop queries, SQL's performance characteristics change dramatically when queries require traversing multiple relationship levels.

## JOIN Operations: Connecting Related Data

**JOIN operations** combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns, typically foreign key relationships. JOINs are fundamental to relational databases because they allow data to be stored in normalized tables (reducing redundancy) while still enabling queries that retrieve related information from multiple tables. Understanding JOIN behavior and performance characteristics is essential for both database design and understanding the limitations RDBMS systems face with highly connected data.

An **inner JOIN** returns only rows where matching values exist in both tables. If a server has no applications, that server won't appear in an inner JOIN between Servers and Applications. Similarly, if an orphaned application references a non-existent server_id (violating referential integrity if constraints aren't enforced), that application won't appear in the results.

```sql
-- Inner JOIN: Show only servers that have at least one application
SELECT s.hostname, a.app_name
FROM Servers s
INNER JOIN Applications a ON s.server_id = a.server_id;
```

An **outer JOIN** returns all rows from one table (LEFT JOIN) or both tables (FULL OUTER JOIN), including rows with no matches, with NULL values filling in missing data from the non-matching side. LEFT JOINs are particularly useful for finding entities without relationships—for example, servers with no applications, which might indicate unused capacity or incomplete data.

```sql
-- Left JOIN: Show all servers, including those with no applications
SELECT s.hostname, COUNT(a.app_id) as app_count
FROM Servers s
LEFT JOIN Applications a ON s.server_id = a.server_id
GROUP BY s.hostname;
```

The distinction between INNER and OUTER JOINs affects both result correctness and query complexity:

| JOIN Type | Syntax | Returns | Use Case |
|-----------|--------|---------|----------|
| INNER JOIN | `FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.key = B.key` | Only matching rows from both tables | Finding related entities that definitely exist in both tables |
| LEFT OUTER JOIN | `FROM A LEFT JOIN B ON A.key = B.key` | All rows from A, matches from B (NULL if no match) | Finding all entities from A, with optional related entities from B |
| RIGHT OUTER JOIN | `FROM A RIGHT JOIN B ON A.key = B.key` | All rows from B, matches from A (NULL if no match) | Rarely used (can rewrite as LEFT JOIN by swapping table order) |
| FULL OUTER JOIN | `FROM A FULL OUTER JOIN B ON A.key = B.key` | All rows from both tables, NULL where no match | Finding all entities from both tables regardless of relationships |
| CROSS JOIN | `FROM A CROSS JOIN B` | Cartesian product: every A row with every B row | Generating all possible combinations (rarely used, often accidental) |

JOIN performance depends on several factors: table sizes, availability of indexes on join columns, selectivity of WHERE filters, and join order. RDBMS query optimizers attempt to execute joins in the most efficient order, processing smaller result sets first when possible. However, as the number of joined tables increases, the optimizer's search space for possible execution plans grows exponentially, and performance can degrade significantly—a key challenge we'll explore further in the multi-hop query section.

## Transitive Dependencies and Multi-Hop Queries

A **transitive dependency** exists when entity A relates to entity B, and entity B relates to entity C, creating an indirect relationship between A and C. In IT infrastructure, transitive dependencies are ubiquitous: a business service depends on an application, which depends on a database, which depends on a server, which depends on a storage array. Understanding these multi-level dependency chains is essential for impact analysis, change management, and root cause diagnosis.

**Multi-hop queries** traverse these transitive dependencies by performing multiple JOIN operations to follow relationship chains across several tables. The "hop count" refers to how many relationship levels the query traverses. A single-hop query joins two tables (e.g., find which applications run on a specific server). A two-hop query joins three tables (e.g., find which data centers host applications). A three-hop query joins four tables, and so on.

Consider a more complex schema representing application dependencies:

```sql
-- Table: Applications
-- Contains basic application information

-- Table: Application_Dependencies (junction table)
-- Links applications that depend on each other
-- Columns: dependency_id, app_id (FK), depends_on_app_id (FK)

-- Find direct dependencies (1-hop)
SELECT a1.app_name as application, a2.app_name as depends_on
FROM Applications a1
INNER JOIN Application_Dependencies d ON a1.app_id = d.app_id
INNER JOIN Applications a2 ON d.depends_on_app_id = a2.app_id
WHERE a1.app_name = 'Customer Portal';

-- Find second-level dependencies (2-hop)
SELECT DISTINCT a3.app_name
FROM Applications a1
INNER JOIN Application_Dependencies d1 ON a1.app_id = d1.app_id
INNER JOIN Application_Dependencies d2 ON d1.depends_on_app_id = d2.app_id
INNER JOIN Applications a3 ON d2.depends_on_app_id = a3.app_id
WHERE a1.app_name = 'Customer Portal';
```

The complexity of multi-hop queries increases dramatically with each additional hop. For a 3-hop query, you need four tables joined together. For a 5-hop query (not uncommon in complex IT estates), you need six tables. Each additional JOIN multiplies the potential intermediate result set size, and query performance often degrades exponentially rather than linearly. This performance degradation is a fundamental limitation of the relational model for highly connected data, which we'll examine in detail in the query performance section.

Moreover, writing multi-hop queries in SQL becomes increasingly awkward as hop count increases. Recursive common table expressions (CTEs) introduced in SQL:1999 provide a more elegant syntax for variable-depth queries, but they don't address the underlying performance concerns. Graph databases, by contrast, make multi-hop traversal a first-class operation with constant-time performance per hop, which is why they've gained traction for use cases like IT dependency management.

## Query Performance and Optimization Challenges

**Query performance** refers to how quickly an RDBMS can execute a query and return results, typically measured in milliseconds or seconds. Performance depends on numerous factors: table sizes, query complexity, index availability, hardware capabilities (CPU speed, memory, disk I/O), concurrent query load, and query optimization quality. While simple single-table queries often execute in milliseconds, complex multi-table joins can take seconds or even minutes, creating significant user experience and operational challenges.

The primary performance bottleneck in RDBMS systems is disk I/O—reading data pages from storage into memory. Modern databases use buffer pools (in-memory caches) to minimize disk access, but when required data isn't cached, disk reads become the limiting factor. Solid-state drives (SSDs) have dramatically improved random access performance compared to spinning hard disk drives (HDDs), yet the fundamental I/O cost remains significant compared to in-memory operations.

Several factors contribute to poor query performance in relational databases:

- **Table scans:** When no appropriate index exists, the RDBMS must read every row in a table to find matching records. For tables with millions of rows, full table scans can take seconds or longer.

- **JOIN complexity:** Each JOIN operation must match rows between tables, potentially creating large intermediate result sets. Nested loop joins (matching every row from table A against every row from table B) exhibit O(n×m) complexity, making them expensive for large tables.

- **Cartesian products:** Forgotten or incorrect JOIN conditions can create accidental cross joins, multiplying result sets disastrously (a 1,000-row table cross joined with another 1,000-row table produces 1,000,000 intermediate rows).

- **Multi-hop traversals:** As discussed in the previous section, following relationship chains through multiple JOINs compounds performance issues, with each hop potentially multiplying intermediate result sizes.

- **Lack of indexes:** Without proper indexes, even simple WHERE clause filters require full table scans. However, over-indexing creates other problems (discussed in the next section).

Query optimizers attempt to mitigate these issues by reordering JOIN operations, choosing appropriate index access paths, and estimating result set sizes based on table statistics. However, optimizer effectiveness diminishes as query complexity increases, and for queries involving more than 5-6 table joins, optimal execution plans become difficult to determine within reasonable optimization time.

The following table compares performance characteristics of different query types:

| Query Type | Complexity | Typical Time | Scalability | Example |
|------------|------------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Single-table with indexed WHERE | O(log n) | < 10ms | Excellent | Find server by ID |
| Single-table with unindexed WHERE | O(n) | 100ms - 1s | Poor | Find servers by unindexed comment field |
| Two-table INNER JOIN (indexed) | O(n log m) | 10-100ms | Good | Find applications for a server |
| Three-table JOIN chain | O(n log m log p) | 100ms - 1s | Moderate | Find data centers hosting applications |
| Multi-hop variable depth (5+ hops) | O(n^k) | 1s - 60s+ | Very poor | Find all transitive dependencies |
| Self-join recursive query | O(n^k) | 10s - timeout | Poor | Organizational hierarchy traversal |

This performance degradation for multi-hop queries is precisely why traditional CMDB implementations struggle with IT dependency management, and why graph databases have emerged as an alternative for relationship-intensive use cases.

## Database Indexes: Accelerating Data Access

A **database index** is an auxiliary data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations at the cost of additional storage space and slower write performance. Conceptually similar to a book's index that lets you quickly find pages containing specific terms, a database index allows the RDBMS to locate rows matching query criteria without scanning the entire table. Indexes are essential for acceptable query performance on large tables.

The most common index type is the B-tree (balanced tree) index, which maintains sorted key values in a tree structure enabling O(log n) search time. When you execute `WHERE server_id = 42`, the RDBMS can use a B-tree index on server_id to locate that specific row in a few tree traversals rather than scanning all rows. For a table with one million rows, a B-tree index might require only 20 comparisons instead of one million scans—a dramatic performance improvement.

Hash indexes provide even faster O(1) lookup for exact equality matches but don't support range queries or sorting. Bitmap indexes efficiently represent columns with low cardinality (few distinct values, such as status fields with values like "active," "inactive," "maintenance"). Composite indexes cover multiple columns, enabling queries that filter or sort by those column combinations.

However, indexes involve important trade-offs:

**Benefits:**
- Dramatically faster SELECT query performance for indexed columns
- Enable efficient sorting (ORDER BY) and grouping (GROUP BY)
- Support fast JOIN operations when join columns are indexed
- Make constraint enforcement (unique keys, foreign keys) efficient

**Costs:**
- Additional disk storage (indexes can consume as much space as the original table)
- Slower INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations (every data modification must also update indexes)
- Maintenance overhead (indexes require occasional rebuilding to maintain balance and efficiency)
- Query optimizer complexity (too many indexes can confuse the optimizer, leading to suboptimal execution plans)

**Query optimization** is the process by which the RDBMS determines the most efficient execution plan for a query. The optimizer considers available indexes, table sizes, data distribution statistics, join order possibilities, and hardware characteristics to estimate the cost of different execution strategies. Based on these estimates, it selects the plan predicted to minimize I/O operations and CPU time.

Effective indexing strategy requires understanding query patterns:

- Index columns frequently used in WHERE clauses
- Index foreign key columns used in JOIN operations
- Index columns used in ORDER BY clauses
- Consider composite indexes for queries filtering multiple columns together
- Avoid over-indexing columns rarely queried
- Monitor slow query logs to identify optimization opportunities

For IT management databases, typical index candidates include: server identifiers, application identifiers, hostname fields, IP addresses, status fields, and foreign keys establishing relationships between tables. However, even with optimal indexing, multi-hop transitive dependency queries remain challenging due to the fundamental architectural differences between relational and graph storage models.

    <summary>B-Tree Index Structure and Search Visualization</summary>
    Type: diagram

## Schema Rigidity and Evolution Challenges

**Schema rigidity** refers to the requirement in relational databases that the schema (table structures, column definitions, data types, relationships) must be defined before data can be stored, and that all rows in a table must conform to the same structure. This "schema-on-write" approach enforces consistency and data integrity but creates challenges when requirements change or when dealing with heterogeneous data that doesn't fit neatly into uniform structures.

The rigidity manifests in several ways. Every row in a table must have the same columns, even if many values are NULL (unknown/missing) for certain rows. Adding a new column requires ALTER TABLE commands that may lock the table during modification, potentially causing downtime for large tables. Changing column data types can require table rebuilds and data conversions. Removing columns requires careful migration to avoid breaking applications that depend on those columns.

**Schema evolution** is the process of modifying database schemas over time as business requirements change, new features are added, or data models are refined. Schema evolution is inevitable in long-lived applications, yet relational databases make certain types of evolution painful:

- **Adding required columns:** New NOT NULL columns require either default values or backfilling existing rows with data, which can take hours or days for large tables.

- **Splitting tables:** Normalizing a table into multiple tables for better design requires data migration, application changes, and usually significant testing.

- **Changing relationships:** Converting a one-to-many relationship to many-to-many requires introducing a junction table and migrating existing foreign keys.

- **Merging tables:** Consolidating similar entity types requires resolving column name conflicts and handling differing constraints.

- **Renaming columns:** Breaks all application code and queries referencing the old name, requiring coordinated deployment.

Organizations manage schema evolution through various techniques:

- **Database migration scripts:** Version-controlled SQL scripts that transform schema from version N to N+1, executed in sequence during deployments
- **Backward-compatible changes:** Adding columns as nullable rather than required, allowing old application versions to continue working
- **Blue-green deployments:** Running old and new schema versions simultaneously during transition periods
- **Feature flags:** Controlling which code paths use new vs. old schema features
- **Deprecation periods:** Maintaining old columns/tables alongside new structures until all applications migrate

For IT management databases, schema rigidity creates particular challenges. IT infrastructure is highly heterogeneous—different server types have different attributes, applications have varying configuration requirements, network devices have vendor-specific properties. Forcing all servers into identical columns with many NULLs for vendor-specific attributes leads to sparse, inefficient schemas. Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) patterns attempt to work around this by storing flexible key-value pairs, but they sacrifice SQL query capabilities and performance.

Graph databases address schema rigidity differently by storing properties directly on nodes and edges without requiring uniform structure. Two server nodes can have completely different properties, and new properties can be added to individual nodes without schema modifications. This flexibility makes graph databases attractive for heterogeneous IT management data, though it trades off some of the consistency guarantees that schemas provide.

The following table contrasts schema approaches:

| Aspect | Relational (Schema-on-Write) | Graph (Schema-on-Read) |
|--------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Structure definition** | Must define before inserting data | Can add properties dynamically |
| **Consistency enforcement** | Strong: database validates all data | Weaker: application enforces consistency |
| **Handling heterogeneity** | Poor: requires many NULL values or EAV | Excellent: different nodes have different properties |
| **Query performance** | Excellent with proper indexes | Excellent for traversals, varied for filters |
| **Evolution difficulty** | High: schema changes require migrations | Low: add properties as needed |
| **Developer experience** | Clear structure aids understanding | Flexibility can lead to inconsistency |

    <summary>Schema Evolution Timeline: Adding Heterogeneous Device Types</summary>
    Type: workflow

    Purpose: Demonstrate the challenges of evolving a relational schema when adding new, heterogeneous entity types with different attributes

    Scenario: An IT asset database initially tracks only servers. Business requirements expand to include network switches, storage arrays, and IoT devices—each with unique attributes.

    Visual style: Horizontal timeline with schema diagrams at each stage, showing table structures evolving

    Stage 1: "Initial schema - Servers only"
    Date: January 2020

    Servers table:
    - server_id (PK)
    - hostname
    - ip_address
    - cpu_count
    - ram_gb
    - os_version

    Note: Clean, simple schema for homogeneous entity type

    Stage 2: "Requirement: Add network switches"
    Date: June 2020

    Problem: Switches have different attributes (port_count, vlan_support, switch_type) that don't apply to servers

    Two possible approaches shown as decision branches:

    Approach A: "Single table with NULLs" (selected)

    Infrastructure table:
    - device_id (PK)
    - device_type (server|switch)
    - hostname
    - ip_address
    - cpu_count (NULL for switches)
    - ram_gb (NULL for switches)
    - os_version (NULL for switches)
    - port_count (NULL for servers)
    - vlan_support (NULL for servers)
    - switch_type (NULL for servers)

    Issues: Many NULL values, sparse table, unclear which columns apply to which device types

    Approach B: "Separate tables" (not chosen)

    Servers table (original) + Switches table (new)
    Issues: Querying all infrastructure requires UNION, can't easily add shared attributes

    Stage 3: "Requirement: Add storage arrays"
    Date: December 2020

    Infrastructure table grows:
    - ... (all previous columns)
    - storage_capacity_tb (NULL for servers and switches)
    - raid_level (NULL for servers and switches)
    - disk_count (NULL for servers and switches)

    Note: Table becoming increasingly sparse, with ~60% NULL values across all rows

    Stage 4: "Requirement: Add IoT sensors"
    Date: June 2021

    Infrastructure table grows further:
    - ... (all previous columns)
    - sensor_type (NULL for servers, switches, storage)
    - battery_level (NULL for servers, switches, storage)
    - last_reading_timestamp (NULL for servers, switches, storage)

    Migration challenge: ALTER TABLE on 100,000-row table takes 4 hours, requires maintenance window

    Note: NULL values now 75% of table content, queries becoming complex with device_type filtering

    Stage 5: "Crisis: Performance degradation"
    Date: January 2022

    Problems identified:
    - Query performance declining due to table size and sparsity
    - Indexes on device-type-specific columns ineffective (too many NULLs)
    - Application logic complicated with device type conditionals
    - Adding new device types requires coordinated schema changes and application deployments

    Decision: Consider alternative architectures

    Stage 6: "Solution: Refactor to graph database"
    Date: June 2022

    Graph model:
    - Device nodes with common properties (id, hostname, ip_address)
    - Node labels by type: :Server, :Switch, :StorageArray, :IoTSensor
    - Type-specific properties stored directly on nodes without NULL padding
    - New device types added without schema migration

    Result:
    - 75% reduction in NULL values
    - Query performance improvement (type-specific queries faster)
    - New device types deployable without database migrations
    - Schema flexibility maintained while keeping type safety

## Key Takeaways

Relational databases have dominated enterprise data management for five decades due to their mathematical rigor, data independence, declarative query language (SQL), and strong integrity guarantees. The relational model excels at managing structured, uniform data with well-defined relationships, making it the foundation for countless business applications. Database schemas enforce structure and consistency, while indexes dramatically improve query performance for common access patterns.

However, relational databases face fundamental challenges when managing highly connected, heterogeneous data such as IT infrastructure dependencies. Multi-hop queries traversing transitive dependencies exhibit exponential performance degradation as hop count increases, with each JOIN operation potentially multiplying intermediate result sets. Schema rigidity makes it difficult to accommodate heterogeneous entity types with varying attributes without resorting to sparse tables with excessive NULL values or complex Entity-Attribute-Value patterns that sacrifice query capabilities.

These limitations become particularly acute for Configuration Management Database (CMDB) implementations attempting to track complex IT estates with deep dependency chains. Understanding these constraints establishes the foundation for appreciating why graph databases—with native graph storage, constant-time traversals, and flexible schemas—offer compelling advantages for relationship-intensive use cases. The next chapter explores graph theory and the mathematical foundations that enable graph databases to address the limitations we've identified in relational approaches.
