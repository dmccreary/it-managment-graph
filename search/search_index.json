Students will explore why legacy Configuration Management Database (CMDB) implementations, built on RDBMS technology, have consistently failed to meet organizational needs despite decades of investment. The course emphasizes how graph databases and real-time graph queries are revolutionizing IT management, providing the multi-hop transitive dependency analysis essential for understanding modern digital estates.</p> <p>Through case studies, hands-on exercises, and industry examples, students will learn to architect, implement, and govern IT management graphs that support critical business decisions around technical debt, regulatory compliance (HIPAA, DORA, GDPR), and digital transformation initiatives.</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<ul> <li>ISMG 510: Database Management Systems</li> <li>ISMG 520: Enterprise Architecture

A learning graph is      a graph of concepts used in this textbook.  Each concept is represented by a      node in a network graph.  Concepts are connected by directed edges that indicate      what concepts each node depends on before that concept is understood by the student.      A learning graph is the foundational data structure for intelligent textbooks that can recommend learning      paths.      A learning graph is like a roadmap of concepts to help students arrive at their learning goals.      \u2026 +86 lines (ctrl+o to expand)</p> <p>\u23fa Read(~/Documents/ws/it-managment-graph/mkdocs.yml)   \u23bf \u00a0Read 63 lines</p> <p>\u23fa Update(~/Documents/ws/it-managment-graph/mkdocs.yml)   \u23bf \u00a0Updated ../../mkdocs.yml with 7 additions                                                          9    nav:        10      - Home: index.md        11      - Course Description: course-description.md        12 +    - Learning Graph:        13 +      - Introduction: learning-graph/index.md        14 +      - Course Description Assessment: learning-graph/course-description-assessment.md        15 +      - Concept List: learning-graph/concept-list.md        16 +      - Graph Quality Analysis: learning-graph/quality-metrics.md        17 +      - Concept Taxonomy: learning-graph/concept-taxonomy.md        18 +      - Taxonomy Distribution: learning-graph/taxonomy-distribution.md        19      - Checklist: checklist.md        20      - Code Highlight Test: code-highlight-test.md        21      - Glossary: glossary.md</p> <p>\u23fa Learning Graph Generation Complete!</p> <p>Congratulations!
